# ecohydroloma
Project for ecohydrology project in Loma Ridge, California

This repository includes the raw data, processing codes, main outputs, and figures accompanying the paper "Impact of drought on ecohydrology of Southern California grassland and shrubland."

- Codes and instructions for the paper's data analysis are found in the file "data_processing_1a".

- Raw data are found in the folder "datasets" as either CSV or text files, depending on the data collection strategy. Additionally, this folder stores some intermediate results, for example the files of the spatial interpolation that were costly to run on a local computer and were run on an HPC.

- Raw and postprocessing figures are found in the folder "figures." All figures were produced in R, and all codes can be found in the file "data_processing_1a". Postprocessing of the figures was done in the software Inkscape. Raw data and final products are also provided. The additional folder called "unused" includes preliminary and test figures.

- The folder "outputs" also includes additional tables that were not included in the final paper. The files include tables of ANOVA and pairwise analyses of the statistical models. The extra folder called "unused" contains some preliminary or test calculation tables.
